            <p>I'm a rising senior who's interested in learning about the intersection of business
                and technology. I've previously had some exposure to different areas of business, and I would like to
                explore how technology can be used to innovate and optimize business processes. I'm currently looking for opportunities 
                to gain hands-on experience in the field as I want to apply + expand my skills.</p>
